# calendar-app

Hello! I am currently working with my team to develop a web-based calendar app. It will have multiple tabs, where the user can add/delete events, view their calendar, view their events listed, a social tab for communicating with other users, and more! This project is being completed with React and Firebase, and can be found on https://github.com/eoinFlynn-NU/CalendarApp. So far, we have learned a lot about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React, and are currently exploring the backend work with Firebase, and are excited to see our idea come to fruition.
